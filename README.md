augh! its a programming lAngUaGe tHat i'm writing



Augh is a programming language.

There are no functions.  Why would you need those?

Indentation is for plebs.

Loops are for scrubs.

Augh stands for lAngUaGe tHat i wrote.

Special features!

Memory management:
    Allocated memory is thrown away fifteen
    minutes after it has been allocated.

    See?  No leaks!  Its great.

Comments:
    Comments are mandatory.
    If the lines of code aren't at least 15%
    comments, the code won't run.

    Trust me, it'll help in the long run.

Lowercase letters:
    Everything is lowercase letters.
    Uppercase letters are wrong and should
    be banned.  They certainly have no
    place in any language of mine.

    This goes for code and strings, but not
    comments.  Comments are just for you.

Types:
    We got types!  Types are fun, fresh,
    healthy, and hot off the grill.

    We got ints.
    We got bools
    We got strings.
    No floats.
    I'm thinking about adding lists.  We'll see.

Control flow:
    It's all goto statements.
    Mimimalism.

I like examples, so here's an example.
Let's write a program that counts from one to ten.
It should output each number as it goes along.

# initialize the counter
int count
count 1

# print the initial count
speakup count

# the maximum to compare the counter against
int max
max 10

# 'here' marks a label you can go to.
# contitional statements work like this:
# First a line that is a boolean.
# Then a line pointing where to go if
# the condition was true.
# Then a line pointing where to go if
# the condition was false.
here conditional
count == max
yep go doneplace
nope go addplace

# a noble spirit increases the count
here addplace
embiggen count
go conditional

# end the program with a nice 'augh'
here doneplace
augh
